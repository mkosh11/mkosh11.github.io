					<h2>10 Principles for Good Design</h2>
                    <h3>Microsite - Design & Development <br> Class: DES-325 - Intro to Web Design <br> October 2025</h3>
                    <h3><a href="https://desweb.uwstout.edu/kosharekm1148/325/TP" target="_blank">View here!</a></h3>
					<p>This is my first significant microsite, where I was tasked with designing a one page site based around Dieter Ram's 10 Principles of Design. This was developed over the course of 1 month, with a moodboard, wireframe ideating, design mockup in Photoshop, and development.</p>

					<p>This was a project completed in my first User Experience course required for my Interaction Design Minor. 
						I have worked on UX in the past, but this class is breaking down the initial research and prototyping steps, focusing on aspects such as a competitive analysis and completing real user interviews. 
						After completing research, this project focused on creating a low-fidelity prototype for the redesign task. This prototype was done on paper and included completing user tests with said paper prototype.
						My research and prototype process is available to view in the linked slide deck, which is a cleaned and tightened version of the entire process.</p>

					<p>Kintsugi 3D is a software solution to enhance photogrammetry efforts at cultural heritage institutions with 2 applications: Builder and Viewer.
						My role in the project is contributing to the artifact configuration settings, which targets collection curators looking to configure properties for models to give public users the best experience when viewing models in the program.
						I am completing full-stack design and development of the user experience, including talking with stakeholders to learn goals and pain points, wireframing and ideating, designing and iterating on interface solutions,
						and finally implementing them using the Godot application.

					<h2>Connie & the Ink Wizard</h2>
                    <h3>Lead Producer, UX Developer, Audio Liason<br>GDD-325 - Exploratory Game Design<br>February 2025-May 2025</h3>
                    <h3><a href="https://smoov-brain-studios.itch.io/connie-and-the-ink-wizard" target="_blank">Play the Game!</a></h3>
					<p> Connie & the Ink Wizard is the second video game designed in my CS/GDD major program, designed with a team of 11 people in an agile development style. This was also developed in collaboration with the National Gallery of Art. 
						This helped our team learn how to communicate and develop a game under the guidance of a stakeholder while still having creative control over the game.
						Play as Connie, a conservator at an art museum working late on a project when a strange statue comes to life and starts meddling with the paintings. It’s up to you to defeat them and their minions and return the art to normal!
